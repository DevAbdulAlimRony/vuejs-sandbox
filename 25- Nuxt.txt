0. Three modes you can use (per route)

Think of Nuxt as having three “page styles”:

SSG (Static) – page is pre-built at deploy time

SSR – page is built on the server on each request

SPA (Client-only) – page is rendered only in the browser with JS

You can mix these in one Nuxt app → this is the hybrid idea.

1. Simple rule to remember

Ask two questions for each page:

Is this page public and needs SEO / sharing?

Does the data change very often or is it mostly stable?

Then:

Public + doesn’t change often → SSG

Public + changes often / per user → SSR

Private (after login) → SPA

That’s the whole game. Now let’s do a “perfect” real-life example.

2. Real-life site example: cpb-agri.com

Imagine you build a Nuxt site:

Public website for CPB

Private CRM dashboards for staff

🔹 Public routes (for everyone)
/ (Home), /about, /contact, /products

Content from CMS or DB, but not changing every minute

Needs SEO + fast loading

Good candidate for SSG

👉 Use SSG
Nuxt will pre-generate the HTML at build time.
Deploy to Netlify/Vercel/CDN → very fast.

/blog, /blog/:slug

Also public, SEO important.

Articles don’t change every 5 seconds.

👉 Use SSG again
Rebuild when new posts are added.

/pricing

Public page

But prices can change frequently (daily/weekly)

Maybe you want always-fresh data from DB

👉 Use SSR
Server renders HTML on every request using latest prices.

🔹 Private routes (only logged-in staff)
/login

Public, but SEO not important

Just a simple form

👉 Can be SSG or SSR (doesn’t really matter).
Most people are fine with SSG (static login page).

/dashboard

Only for logged-in staff

Shows sales, charts, metrics

Data is user-specific and real-time-ish

👉 Use SPA (client-only)
No SEO needed, just load JS and fetch data via API.

/crm/farmers, /crm/flocks, /crm/reports

All behind login

Dynamic filters, tables, pagination

Depends on user, date filters, etc.

👉 Use SPA (client-only)
Pure app experience, no need for SSR/SSG.

3. Put it in one small table
Route	Who uses it?	SEO needed?	Data type	Mode to use
/ (Home)	Public	✅ Yes	Mostly static	SSG
/about, /contact	Public	✅ Yes	Static	SSG
/products, /products/:slug	Public	✅ Yes	Mostly static	SSG
/blog, /blog/:slug	Public	✅ Yes	Static-ish	SSG
/pricing	Public	✅ Yes	Changes often	SSR
/login	Public	❌ No	Simple form	SSG/SSR (either)
/dashboard	Private	❌ No	Per-user, dynamic	SPA
/crm/*	Private	❌ No	Highly dynamic app	SPA

A login page does NOT need SEO.
And in almost every project, it is actually bad if search engines index your login page.
// <meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow"> : Add this in login page then.

If Laravel Blade already renders your HTML + meta tags + SEO content, and Vue is only used as an SPA inside that Blade page →
you do NOT need Nuxt at all.
Laravel + Blade + Vue is already enough.

For public website / SEO / marketing → Nuxt usually wins
For internal tools / admin / CRM / simple hosting → Blade usually wins
